      "claim: , notes: DESCRIPTION: the claim, made by candace owens, is that because black Americans commit more crime, that is why they are killed by the police. Her methodology is flawed.  “These quantities can differ enormously: When officers encounter many more white civilians (due to whites’ majority status, for example), the proportion of killings involving black civilians can be small, even if encounters with black civilians are more likely to end in shootings.” “Black women and men and American Indian and Alaska Native women and men are significantly more likely than white women and men to be killed by police. “\n",

      "claim: , notes: The claim is that the Story County auditor explained how 729 voters sent their ballots to the wrong location.  What happened in Ames, Iowa, is that 729 voters got the wrong ballot. This story broke in October 2020, before Election Day.  They did not send their ballots to the wrong location.  Misinformation, factually inaccurate.  \n",

Sinclair is known for being less than reliable, and he was represented at his press conference about Obama by an attorney whose law license had been suspended. After his press conference, Sinclair was arrested on charges of theft and forgery.  Ruling: misinfo, N/A \n",
